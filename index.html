        <p>I have five years of photography experience. Accompanying that, I also have five years of Lightroom photo editing experience. I am excited about my most recent adventure, learning the skills to become a web
          developer!</p>

        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>At one point and time photography started to resemble a job, and I hated that. As a result, I officially moved it back into the hobbies category and I have found my love for it all over again. If I'm not out with a camera in my hand, you
          will more than likely find me embracing a guitar. I've been playing music since I was a teenager and still enjoy doing that from time to time. Also, not to say that everyone who loves music loves to dance, but I definitely do. I pride
          myself in dancing like no one is watching! I once even danced with a chicken!</p>
